# SmarterTabSwitching

## Features:
1. Switching to most recently used tab from CTRL+TAB
2. Holding down CTRL + TAB brings up previews
3. Customizable keybindings
4. Original functionality with left-right movement on new keybinds (CTRL + Left & right)

## Stretch Goals:
1. “Pinned Tabs”: Keybind to open a specific tab regardless of placement or recency
2. Tab sorting by similar domains (.google.com, etc.)
